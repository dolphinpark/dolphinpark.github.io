## League Rules

As of 2018, we have transitioned from a redraft league into a keeper league. This means some changes to what we’ve done in the past. All of these are debatable, if you have any concerns or suggestions feel free to bring them up and we can discuss.

Note: These rules were taking from the original document seen here: [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mteDWxl_k1o5M1ewCmzkMov5cT64Nm-PAv40IKVRbII)

#### Draft
 - For our first season, we will be holding a standard snake draft with a random, Yahoo generated draft order. 
 - For all future seasons the draft order will be determined by reverse regular season standings order and **will not be snaking**. 
     - To prevent tanking, the positions 9--12 in the regular season standings will, in order, hold the first 4 picks, followed by reverse order for the positions 1-12.
     - To clarify: the draft pick order, based on regular season standings, is: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 8th, 7th, 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st.

#### Keepers
- Prior to the start of each future season, you will be allowed to select **3 players** from your roster at the end of the prior season as “keepers”. These players will remain on your roster as you go into the draft and the following season, instead of entering the player pool from which the draft will occur. 
- Your most basic keeper leagues have no rules regarding who you can choose as your keepers. 
- However, some leagues have rules regarding the following aspects. We are **not** implementing these.
    - Position: Everyone must keep x number of guards, y number of forwards, z number of centres.
    - Length: As mention in the previous point, some leagues have a limit on the number of years you can keep a player before you are forced to release them into the draft pool. 
- However, due to demand, we **are** implementing keeper rules regarding:
    - Draft round: Your keepers eat up the future draft pick that they were previously drafted in. If next summer you decide to keep your third, sixth and tenth round picks from this 2017-2018 season, for the 2018-2019 draft, you would give up your third, sixth and tenth round picks. 
        - If a player was not originally drafted by any team, and you acquired them last season from waivers, they cost you your **10th** round pick. ~~This is true *even if* the player was originally drafted. So, if a player was drafted in the 2nd round and dropped, and later in the season, a team picked them up, they would still cost a 10th.~~ As of 2022, any player that is drafted maintains their original draft value, regardless of any in-season transactions.
        - If you kept your 2nd round pick through the year and traded for someone else's 2nd round pick during the season, the keeper cost would be the next higher round pick. (In the case of 2 1st rounders, the next lowest pick is used instead) 
        - If you previously kept a player in round *n*, the following year the draft round cost would be round *n/2*, rounded up to the next highest round. For example, a previously kept 7th rounder would cost a 3rd rounder in the following year.
    - When trading, adding waivers, or adding free agents, the draft round cost follows the player.
    - When you are trading draft picks, you must be trading an equal number of picks both ways for us to maintain draft and roster size integrity in future years. 

#### Other rules
Beyond that most other rules should be consistent with what we have traditionally used. 
You can view this in the league settings page but for the lazy:
 - 12 teams, 9 cat h2h
 - No max pickups or trades 
 - Will have a trade deadline
 - Can trade next years draft picks
 - Standard, continual rolling waivers, 2 day waiver period
 - League votes on trade review 
 - 4 pickups per week
 - Pickups: Daily - Tomorrow
 - Playoffs: exclude the final super long final week of the season
 - Playoff tiebreak: best regular season record vs opponent wins
 - No playoff reseeding (I’d like to change this. Anyone else?)
 - No divisions
